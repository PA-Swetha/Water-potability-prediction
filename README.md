# Water-potability-prediction
Developed a Water Potability Prediction Model to assess the safety of water sources based on various quality parameters. Utilized machine learning algorithms to classify water as potable or non-potable. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation for accurate predictions.
